If you're using our directory to create a product or service we would appreciate if you would spread the word about this project.
It's not mandatory, but definitely helps us to grow bigger and the entire API ecosystem will benefit.

Pages which show info from our directory should have one of the following links:
 - **Powered by \<LOGO\>**
 - **API definitions supplied by \<LOGO\>**

All links should point to https://APIs.guru.

You should use only official logos:

| [Logo]| [Horizontal logo]| [Vertical logo]|
|-------|------------------|----------------|
|![Logo]|![Horizontal logo]|![Vertical logo] |

The correct way to write our name is **APIs.guru** with exactly this combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
We recommended using the [Sansation](http://www.dafont.com/sansation.font) font, or simply use the logo with the name included.
